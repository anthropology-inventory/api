## About the Project
This app was created in partnership with _Madeleine Aguilar_ -- a professor working in the Department of Anthropology at Green River College. Its main purpose is to solve the growing need for digital inventory and archival of specimens.

## Tech Stack (backend)
**[Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en):** for bulding the backend API

**[Express](https://expressjs.com/):** framework for Node.js, helped streamline development.

**[MongoDB Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/products/platform/atlas-database):** database

**[Cloudinary](https://cloudinary.com/):** free image hosting
